                      seems to be talking about the Internet, so what exactly is
                      it? The Internet is a computer network that connects
                      people all across the world. It is not owned or controlled
                      by any single organization or government. The spirit of
                      the Internet is to be open and share information with the
                      world.&nbsp;<BR>
                          <BR>
                      The Internet is fast becoming the preferred medium of
                      communication for businesses of all sizes. Having an
                      Internet Presence is no longer a luxury, but a necessity
                      for most companies.<BR>
                          <BR>
                      While large companies can afford to hire a dedicated team
                      of specialists to design, build, and exploit the
                      commercial aspects of the Internet, smaller companies are
                      often confused and intimidated by their perception of what
                      it takes to get their company on the net.<BR>
                          <BR>
                      Actually the process of getting your company on the
                      Internet is quite simple and can be done in 4 simple
                      steps:&nbsp;
                          <OL>
                          <LI>
 Choose an Internet address
                          </LI>
                          <LI>

                          </LI>
                          <LI>

                          </LI>
                          <LI>
 Find an Web Service Provider to host the services.
                          </LI>
                          </OL>

                          <B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#9267A2">Internet Address</FONT></B><BR>
                      To get an Internet address that symbolizes the name of a
                      company involves a process known as &quot;Domain Name
                      Registration&quot; or DNS in short. Similar to performing
                      a name search and registering a company with the Registrar
                      of Companies, one has to go through an Internet name
                      search and get it registered through an Internet Service
                      Provider (ISP).&nbsp;<BR>
                          <BR>
                      While there are several options available, getting a
                      &quot;&lt;companyname&gt;.com&quot; address is the most
                      preferred. Because of the popularity of the Internet most
                      of the common .com names have already been registered.<BR>
                          <BR>
                      Another option is for companies to register a sub-domain
                      name, (&quot;&lt;companyname&gt;.&lt;ispname&gt;.com&quot;)
                      where the &lt;companyname&gt; is actually the sub-domain
                      of &lt;ispname&gt;.com.<BR><BR>
                      While domain registration typically costs about US $ 
                      70 for 2 years, sub domain registrations are usually 
                      free.</TD>

                      <P>The Internet address provides you with an internet
                      identity. It's importance is understood only when used
                      with services such as e-mail (electronic mail), WWW (World
                      Wide Web), ftp (File Transfer Protocol) etc.<BR>

                      <FONT COLOR="#9267A2" FACE="Arial"><B>e-mail</B></FONT><BR>
                      e-mail is the foundation upon which the Internet is built.
                      With e-mail services a company would typically provide
                      e-mail ids' such as <B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&lt;user&gt;@&lt;companyname&gt;.com</FONT></B>
                      to its employees to facilitate official communication with
                      the rest of the world. In general, companies have an info
                      e-mail account, <B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">info@&lt;companyname&gt;.com</FONT></B>,&nbsp;
                      that is analogous to the main telephone number.<BR>
                      <BR>
                      <B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#9267A2">Web site</FONT></B><BR>
                      The Internet as we know today is vastly associated with
                      the World Wide Web. It is a service (similar to e-mail)
                      that companies use to share information. It allows a
                      company to post information (web pages) about its
                      products/services for access by anybody on the Internet.
                      The web pages are formatted in an English-like computer
                      language known as HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language).<BR>
                      <BR>
                      The web site of a company is accessed by its Internet
                      address, such as <B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">www.&lt;companyname&gt;.com</FONT></B>.<BR>
                      <BR>
                      Having a web site today is fashionable.But, very few
                      companies are taking full advantage of the rich medium
                      offered by the Internet. A company that is serious about
                      its Internet presence, needs to put in a lot of thought
                      and effort in its web site on a continual basis.<BR>
                      <BR>
                      <FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#9267A2"><B>Internet Hosting</B></FONT><BR>
                      Services, such as e-mail and WWW, are accessible only when
                      they are hosted on a server that is permanently connected
                      to the Internet. While there are lots of software that
                      provide these functionalities to any computer, being on
                      the internet opens up issues such as security,
                      reliability, backup &amp; restore, etc.<BR>
                      <BR>
                      For a fee, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) typically
                      provide the appropriate infrastructure along with
                      management of such services. These services, as provided
                      by ISPs, are typically known as web site hosting, e-mail
                      hosting, network management, etc.</TD>
