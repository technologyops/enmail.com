                      the Chennai-based total e-mail solution provider is the <b>First
                      Indian company</b> to announce a major Open Source
                      Initiative. enmail has launched a messaging communication
                      system based on open source components.&nbsp;

                      <font face="Times New Roman"> Being
                      an Open Source software, this product from enmail removes
                      all barriers of entry for potential users in India and the
                      rest of the world. Open Source is an embodiment of the
                      philosophy that “knowledge is meant to be discovered and
                      shared freely”. The Internet provides the <i>medium</i>

                      Xchange is the lead contribution to the Internet Community
                      from the company. This is a software application that
                      works on Microsoft platform, which bridges the gap between
                      an organization’s internal and external messaging
                      communication systems. This indigenous mail management
                      software reduces communication costs for a firm by
                      connecting to the Internet periodically and downloading
                      all incoming messages and uploading all outgoing messages
                      using a single connection. Further, this software
                      complements intranet messaging applications, such as,
                      Microsoft Exchange Server, Lotus Notes, Sendmail, etc.&nbsp;

                      Karthik Iyer,</b> <i>CEO,</i>
                      Enmail.com said, &quot;The initial need for this kind of
                      software came from our existing customers. Though there
                      are closed sourced alternatives, they have been overpriced
                      and under-featured. Having developed it with relative
                      ease, we felt it would benefit other companies with
                      similar requirements. Thus, this is our first Open Source
                      contribution. And, to encourage software that is <i>Made
                      in India</i>, we need world-class products that are
                      designed and developed for the global marketplace.&quot;

                      Quality:</b> The open source
                      model of development virtually assures a high quality
                      product. Because the source code is published on the
                      Internet, the developers are typically careful about the
                      quality of the code written. Larger open source projects
                      take advantage of a team of specialized developers
                      contributing from their respective areas of expertise,
                      which virtually guarantees the highest quality software
                      developed in the shortest span of time.&nbsp;

                      </b>Open source
                      provides true freedom of expression. The user is given the
                      choice of using the software, the developer the choice of
                      modifying the software, and the critic the chance to
                      review the software.&nbsp;

                      methodology ensures longevity of the software, since it
                      allows more qualified and interested people to continue
                      the maintenance &amp; development of the project, long

                      is a practice that implements the philosophy of
                      &quot;sharing knowledge without any pre-conceived

                      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Usually software is written using a human readable
                      computer language, such as, C, Pascal, Java, etc. which is
                      known as source code. This source code is then converted
                      into a machine code through a process known as
                      compilation. This compiled application is then distributed
                      and sold in the market. The creator company typically does
                      not offer the source code of the software and are thus
                      referred to as &quot;closed source&quot;.&nbsp;

                      <font face="Times New Roman">Software,
                      which follows an open source methodology, enables the
                      users to make use of the applications (executable) freely,
                      it even allows other programmers to modify the source code
                      to suit their unique requirements. Internet and open
                      source are synonymous and epitomizes the same philosophy.
