<p class="body_headers">About TEXLA:</p>
<div style="padding-right:33px; text-align:justify;" class="body_font">


<p>Do you spend a minimum of two hours each day commuting from your home to your  place of work? Do you feel you are wasting a lot of time, money and effort in just commuting? Do you wish you had an easier alternative that would facilitate productive work without the commute and associated delays/hassles. If yes, then TEXLA is the place for you.</p>

<p>TEXLA is specifically designed to be a co working space. The concept of co working spaces or shared office spaces has been gaining popularity in the west for a number of years. However the concept has yet to gain traction in the Indian context.</p>

<p>With the advent of technology specifically mobile communcation, and wireless connectivity the paradigm of people being physically present at the office on a daily basis is changing. Virtual teams connect people across the world in diverse geographic locations to work together on multiple projects. Remote login enables professionals to connect to their organizations anywhere, anytime, and access all relevant data. Infact many companies prefer their executives do not come to office on a daily basis as it saves the company money, in terms of expenses paid to executives for travel, better work space utilization at offices (every single person no longer needs a desk and chair), as well as savings on resources utilized at the office (paper, copying, canteen meals, etc).</p>

<p>There are also benefits to the individual employee. Less stress due to the fact that they do not have to battle traffic to commute to work everyday. Lowered trasnportation costs, and a saving on opportunity costs which would normally have been wasted on travel time. </p>

<p>However people still prefer to travel to office inspite of the fact that they no longer have to do so. This is primarily due to the fact that not everybody has the required amenities at home to carry out their jobs (high speed internet, conferencing facilities, and multiple distractions at home). Or the fact that they are simply not aware of any alternatives.</p>

<p><strong>TEXLA offers a viable alternative. The list of facilities that you will have at your disposal are :</strong></p>
