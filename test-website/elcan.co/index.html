<p class="body_headers">About ELCAN:</p>
<div style="padding-right:33px; text-align:justify;" class="body_font">
<p>ELCAN endeavours to create a new niche in the real estate industry - Professional Land Bankers.  ELCAN's primary focus is centered around becoming the most trusted, viable alternative for land owners who wish to sell or develop their land parcels. ELCAN will provide a transparent, open, trustworthy platform for an existing land owner to achieve their objectives.</p>

<p> There are several roles that ELCAN plays. These include :</p>

<ul class="body_font" style="list-style:url(images/arrow.jpg);">
<li class="ul_padding">Land Aggregation</li>
<li class="ul_padding">Project Development </li>
<li class="ul_padding">Project Funding</li>
<li class="ul_padding">Project Execution </li>
</ul>


<p>Interested land owners approach ELCAN. ELCAN then assess' the title, site, its potential and the owners objectives. ELCAN prepares a creative project proposal depending on the USP of the land. These proposals are then discussed with our partners, the Real Estate Private Equity (REPE) Funds in order to raise equity/funding for the project. Once this is firmed up, the next step involves identifying developers to actually execute the project. ELCANs primary role is to act as a catalyst between the Land owners, developers and the Real Estate Private Equity Funds. Specialised areas such as legal, architectural design and construction are outsourced by ELCAN to best in class service providers.</p>

<p>Being Land Bankers, ELCAN does much more than construct homes and develop properties. We raise resources, not just for land acquisition, but for entire projects, thereby creating a value proposition for all the parties involved in the chain.</p>

<p>ELCAN operates in an environment of integrity, trust, and transparency, all of which are central to the company’s value system. Not to mention the fact that all our dealings are carried out with the utmost professionalism and diligence.</p>

<p>The team at ELCAN are young, dynamic and vastly experienced sharing collectively between them over 100 years of experience in developing and executing various heavy industry projects. </p>

<p>Our office is amidst the landmark project: The Jus' Trufs building at Jakkur, Bangalore which is testament to our ability to do things differently.</p>
