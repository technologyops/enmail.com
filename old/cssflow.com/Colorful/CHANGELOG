# Version 2.0

  * Refactor most components (some filenames have changed).

  * New components: button dropdowns, headings, tables and alerts.

  * Increase the default size of most elements.

  * Add focus state of dropdown lists (selects) and switches.

  * Change markup of checkboxes and radios, and add variable size.

  * Fix placeholder pseudo-class in recent versions of Firefox and IE 10.

  * Fix vertical alignment of dropdown lists in Firefox.

  * Drop support for Safari 4 (usage share below .03%).

# Version 1.1

  * New components: search inputs and validation.

  * Use a check mark icon instead of a Unicode character inside checkboxes.

  * Update the "linear-gradient" mixin to support the new, standard syntax.
    (fixes gradients in IE 10)

  * Fix the "active" background of directional buttons in browsers that don't
    support gradients.

  * Use Verdana instead of Tahoma on Windows.

  * Extract IE 8-specific styling of dropdown lists (selects).
    (IE 8 bug fixes are kept separate to highlight what the issues are and to
    allow easy removal in case you don't require IE 8 support.)

  * Minor code consistency and clean-up.
