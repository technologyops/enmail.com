This Hindu School was upgraded into a Training Institution, meant for training Elementary and Secondary Grade Women teachers, in the year 1913.In the year 1922,the Training Institute was renamed as 'Lady Willingdon Training School' after the name of the wife of the then Governor of Madras Presidency..
